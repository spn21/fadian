就像历史中的印第安人他们终究没有等到他们的杰克，历史的主角并没有站在他们这边，也没有幸运之神去眷顾他们，并没有什么勇士或者红龙去扭转战局，甚至都没有能形成联军去抵抗，而是被残忍地，不公正地被对待。尽管有法律能给予一定的特权，但是印第安人远远还没有达到和白人一样平等的地位，如受教育权。

在电影中，尤其是战争中杰克可以靠纳美人的红龙去向侵略的人类去抗争，而且潘多拉星球中的各种野兽如锤头雷兽，死神兽等可以在第二次战争中帮助纳威人去抵抗人类侵略者的攻击。历史中的印第安人只有落后的长矛去对抗拥有千百倍火力的欧洲移民。电影只能给出一个好结局，而现实是残酷的，一边倒的杀戮，火枪是主要武器，霍乱和天花是帮凶。有可能对于印第安人来说，现实中的结局可能在第一场战争的惨败就已经结束了，紧接着就是家园被破坏种群被屠戮殆尽，类似于翻盘的第二场战争永远不会等到。印第安人被屠戮的残酷也远比电影中的人类对纳威人的残酷程度更高，幸存下来的印第安人并没有遭到公正的对待，他们也没有能力去团结在一起去为自己的权力去斗争。

如果如今的美国人真的有真挚的内心去向印第安人道歉，我认为更应该落实到行动上而不只是去拍摄一部电影仅限于表面。这部电影虽然表面是人类对外星文明侵略的失败的反思，但是它的内核还是很经典的美式英雄风格，比如最后的高潮就是杰克和上校的一对一搏斗。对道歉，尤其是对历史，过去的道歉更应该落实到行动上，更应该用实际行动去争得受害者的原谅而不是加害人去美化侵略行为。人们在看完这部电影后，应该更感慨的是电影强大特效的制作效果而不是去反思之前的侵略行为









I don't think the Avatar film is sincere enough as a letter of apology to the Indians that were 500 years overdue.

Just like the Indians in history, they did not wait for their jack after all, the protagonists of history did not stand on their side, there was no god of luck to favor them, there were no warriors or red dragons to turn the tide of the war, and they did not even form a coalition to resist, but were cruelly and unjustly treated. Despite the privileges granted by law, Indians were far from achieving the same level as whites, such as the right to education.

In the movie, especially in the war, Jack can rely on the red dragon of the Na'vi to fight against the invading humans, and various beasts on the planet Pandora, such as hammerhead thunder beasts and death beasts, can help the Na'vi to resist the attacks of human invaders in the second war. The Indians in history had only backward spears to fight against European settlers with a thousand times more firepower. The film can only give a good ending, while the reality is brutal, one-sided killing, muskets are the main weapons, cholera and smallpox are accomplices. It is possible that for the Indians, the real outcome may have ended with the crushing defeat of the first war, followed by the destruction of the homeland and the slaughter of the population, and the second war similar to the overturn will never wait. The slaughter of Indians is also far more cruel than the humans in the movie to the Na'vi, and the surviving Indians are not treated justly, and they do not have the ability to unite to fight for their power.

If today's Americans really have a sincere heart to apologize to the Indians, I think it should be more implemented in action than just making a movie, which is limited to the surface. Although this movie is a reflection on the failure of human aggression against extraterrestrial civilizations on the surface, its core is still a classic American hero style, such as the final climax is the one-on-one fight between Jack and the colonel. For apologies, especially for history, past apologies should be implemented in action, and practical actions should be used to win the forgiveness of the victims rather than the perpetrators to glorify the aggressive behavior. After watching this movie, people should be more moved by the production effect of the film's powerful special effects than to reflect on the previous aggression
